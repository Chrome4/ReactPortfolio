        My name is Kyle and I am a full stack developer in the making. I have
        learned countless new technologies. I have learned the Mern stack
        primarly. My favorite technology is the mysql database. I think its
        pretty amazing how you you can get data and save it. I have learned a
        ton recently and cant wait to bring my ideas to life.
